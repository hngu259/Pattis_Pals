     * - The user will then be prompted to select what muscle group they would
     * like to work on for this workout.
     * - Upon selecting a muscle group from the menu, machines related to that
     * muscle group will be shown.
     * - When a machine is selected, machine name, location, and max load weight
     * will be displayed.
     * - User should be able to navigate back and forth between muscle list
     * and machine list.
     * - As the user gets through the workout, a queue will be created, storing
     * machines used(possibly save what weight was lifted).
     * - Once the user has completed their workout, a workout summary will be
     * displayed, showing machines used(possibly display what weight was
     * lifted).
